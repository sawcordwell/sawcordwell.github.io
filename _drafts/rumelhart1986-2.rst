===========================================
Storing the information in two family trees
===========================================

This is part two of my attempt at recreating the results presented in `Rumelhart, Hinton and Williamsâ€™ 1986 paper in Nature <http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v323/n6088/abs/323533a0.html>`_.
`Last time <http://sawcordwell.wordpress.com/rumelhart-hinton-williams-1>`_ I trained a neural network to detect symmetry about the centre point of a vector using GNU Octave.
This time I will reuse those functions to train a neural network to store the information contained in two family trees.
